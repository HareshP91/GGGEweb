            <p>1.2    These Terms prevail over any Purchaser’s terms regardless of when such terms are provided.
                Fulfilment of Purchaser's order does not constitute acceptance of any of Purchaser's terms and does not
                serve to modify or amend these Terms.</p>
            <p>1.3    Certain Products and Services may be subject to additional terms (“Supplemental Terms”) not
                contained herein, which, when applicable, may be referenced on or provided with Sales Documents or
                Seller’s websites or provided by Seller upon request.</p>
            <p>1.4    The Agreement between Seller and Purchaser is created when Seller confirms, acknowledges or begins

                written consent. Modification or cancellation may require payment by Purchaser of certain costs incurred
                by Seller.</p>
